# AdventOfCode2015
# Don't clone, code is fun!
Just as I've been roaming the beaches of github because I got stuck solving aoc puzzles, you probably landed here too because you couldn't get any further. That's exactly why this code is here: To help you further solve the puzzle. So it is not the intention that you run the code with your own puzzle and then enter the solution, it is not forbidden but what good is it? You don't buy a puzzle in the store to have your mother-in-law make it, do you? Just do it yourself, even if it takes weeks, the satisfaction is all the greater :)
